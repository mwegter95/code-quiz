# Code Quiz

## Bootcamp challenge 4

This repository contains HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to run a quiz game application in a web browser.

The html page loads up with a start button. After the user hits start, they will be prompted with a series of questions about JavaScript code, and a timer will start counting down from two minutes. User scores 100 points for every correct answer, but loses 20 seconds from the timer for every incorrect answer. The time remaining in seconds is added to the users score at the end of the quiz. After the user answers the questions, or the timer gets to zero, the quiz is over and a page to save your score to local storage is shown.
